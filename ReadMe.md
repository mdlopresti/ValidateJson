# ValidateJson

Schema validation for older PowerShell.

## Description

Test-Json is not implemented for Powershell 5.1, however there are many Powershell modules out there that do not support Powershell V6 or 7.  this module fills that gap.  The version of the function in this module is a direct drop-in replacement, accepting the exact same parameters.

The project relies on the  [NJsonSchema](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NJsonSchema) nugget package.
